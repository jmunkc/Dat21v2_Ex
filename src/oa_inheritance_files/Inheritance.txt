Inheritance

Inheritance is one of the four pillars of object-oriented programming. It allows for one or more classes to inherit
the state and behaviour of another class by extending its attributes and methods. These classes are respectively
referred to as child- or sub-class and parent- or super-class. A sub-class is extended by adding the keyword extends
and then the super-class name, to its own class name. Fields and methods of the super-class can be reached from a
sub-class by invoking the super keyword. Inheritance provides the ability to create a multitude of hierarchically
ordered sub-classes with shared functionality but with the possibility of differentiated behaviour implemented, in the
sub-class, by adding further attributes, methods or overriding methods inherited by the super-class. Java has an inbuilt
super-class called "Object" automatically extended by all objects. "Object" provides commonly used methods like equals()
and toString(). Inheritance also allows for the utilization of polymorphism in programming i.e., by creating methods
that takes a super-class as parameter or return type, said method is the applicable to all inheriting sub-classes.
